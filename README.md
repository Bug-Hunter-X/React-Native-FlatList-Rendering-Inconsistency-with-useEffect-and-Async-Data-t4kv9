# React Native FlatList Rendering Inconsistency

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in React Native related to the interaction between the `useEffect` hook, asynchronous operations, and the `FlatList` component. The bug results in inconsistent rendering of list items, particularly after data updates or screen rotations.

## Bug Description

The primary issue is that asynchronous data fetching within a `useEffect` hook doesn't always correctly update the `FlatList`'s rendered items.  This can lead to stale data being displayed or some items not rendering at all.

## Bug Reproduction

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run the app on an iOS or Android simulator or device.
4. Observe the list items as you interact with the app, particularly after data updates or screen rotation. You'll likely see inconsistent rendering.

## Solution

The solution involves using techniques to ensure data fetching and rendering are synchronized and that `FlatList` receives the correct data at the right time. See `bugSolution.js` for the corrected code.
